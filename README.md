# Label Commands

> Github Action to perform commands when issues or pull requests are labeled or unlabeled.

## How It Works

This Github Action performs certain commands when an issue or pull request is labeled or unlabeled. The following commands are supported:

- Post a comment (`comment` and `reactions` option)
- Close (`close` option)
- Reopen (`open` option)
- Lock with an optional lock reason (`lock` and `lockReason` options)
- Unlock (`unlock` option)
- Pin (`pin` option, pin an issue)
- UnPin (`unpin` option, unpin an issue)
- Add or remove labels (`labels` option), label prefixed with `-` will be removed, other label will be added. Support array of labels or space separated labels.

## Usage

```yaml

  pull_request:
    types: [labeled, unlabeled]
